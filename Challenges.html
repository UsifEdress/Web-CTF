After reviewing the logs, we found that a single user had viewed multiple profiles they shouldn't have access to—all without any login bypass or brute force. our security team thought being very intellegent as they are using cryptography way to make it harder on the attacker but the attacker was very curuios.</p><p>🕵️ <strong>Your Mission:</strong><br>Investigate how the attacker was able to jump between user accounts without hacking credentials. what did they do?</p></div><hr><div><h3><strong>Second Challenge</strong></h3><p>📅 <strong>Incident Report:</strong><br>At <strong>2:30 PM</strong>, an unauthorized user was seen accessing the Higher Privilege part of our website. There were no login attempts from their account, no stolen passwords, and no sign of brute-force attacks. Yet, somehow, they managed to reach a high level place in our web Application meant only for administrators.</p><p>🕵️ <strong>Your Mission:</strong><br>Figure out how a regular user walked straight into that place without cracking a single password. Did they find an unlocked door?</p></div><hr><div><h3><strong>Third Challenge</strong></h3><p>📅 <strong>Incident Report:</strong><br>At <strong>5:15 PM</strong>, a normal user suddenly gained admin privileges without permission. Logs show that they made a request to the server, No database tampering, no password changes—just flipping the switch.</p><p>🕵️ <strong>Your Mission:</strong><br>Investigate how the hacker tricked the system into granting them admin powers?</p></div><hr><div><h3><strong>Fourth Challenge</strong></h3><p>📅 <strong>Incident Report:</strong><br>At <strong>9:10 AM</strong>, an unauthorized user downloaded an important system file that was never meant to be accessed publicly. The logs show that they used a standard file download feature—but something about their request was different, our Security team with the leader: Shimaaaaaaaaaaaaa tried to make it more secure and harder by Blocking "../" but the hacker bypassed it how did he do that.</p><p>🕵️ <strong>Your Mission:</strong><br>How did the attacker bypassed the restrictions? what did they use to escape the intended directory?</p></div><hr><div><h3><strong>Fifth Challenge</strong></h3><p>📅 <strong>Incident Report:</strong><br>At <strong>8:00 AM</strong>, our finance team noticed that a user had been requesting refunds and instead of losing money, their balance <strong>increased</strong> until it reached 5 million dollars$. He stolen thousands of dollars—without triggering any fraud alerts.</p><p>🕵️ <strong>Your Mission:</strong><br>Find out how the attacker abused the refund system. Could they have exploited a weakness in the way of money processing? Can You be Rich like him?</p></div><hr><div><h3><strong>Sixth Challenge</strong></h3><p>📅 <strong>Incident Report:</strong><br>At <strong>11:50 PM</strong>, a contestant in an online voting competition suddenly gained a massive number of votes in a short period. The system was designed to allow only one vote per user, yet the logs show the same person voting <strong>hundreds of times</strong>. No fake accounts, no bot activity—just one persistent voter.</p><p>🕵️ <strong>Your Mission:</strong><br>How did they bypass the one-vote limit? Did they discover a flaw in how the system tracks votes?</p></div><hr><div><h3><strong>Seventh Challenge</strong></h3><p>📅 <strong>Incident Report:</strong><br>At <strong>4:20 PM</strong>, an attacker accessed internal services that should never have been exposed to the public. They used a feature that allows fetching data from external URLs, but instead of loading a normal webpage, they accessed <strong>our own</strong> internal resources, After that he <strong>Enumerated our Services</strong>, but that hacker was very very intellegent to do that he was not a normal hacker.</p><p>🕵️ <strong>Your Mission:</strong><br>How did they trick the server into exposing internal data? how did he opened that specific ear??</p></div><hr><div><h3><strong>Eighth Challenge</strong></h3><p>📅 <strong>Incident Report:</strong><br>At <strong>3:45 AM</strong>, a user logged in without ever entering a password. The login logs show a strange input in the password field, but the system accepted it and granted access to an admin account.</p><p>🕵️ <strong>Your Mission:</strong><br>How did they manipulate the login form to bypass authentication?</p></div><hr><div><h3><strong>Ninth Challenge</strong></h3><p>📅 <strong>Incident Report:</strong><br>Long ago, in the heart of the Roman Empire, there lived a great leader named Julius Caesar. He was a brilliant general, a cunning politician, and a master of strategy.

These messengers could be captured, and the messages could fall into the wrong hands. Caesar needed a way to protect his communications, so he devised a clever method—a cipher that would later be named after him: the Caesar Cipher.</p><p>🕵️ <strong>Your Mission:</strong><br>solve the next encypted data by Caesar Cipher using the key which is my name? do you know who am i?</p></div><hr><div><h3><strong>Tenth Challenge</strong></h3><p>📅 <strong>Incident Report:</strong><br>At <strong>12:00 PM</strong>, our homepage logo was mysteriously replaced with an unknown image. Further investigation revealed that a hacker opened his image many times in a weired way. Shortly after, they gained unauthorized access to our files.</p><p>🕵️ <strong>Your Mission:</strong><br>Find out how the hacker destoryed our machine? Could they have tricked the system into executing their code?</p></div></body></html>
