">Profile</a><h2>"يا فاشل يا فاشل"</h2><div class="gallery"><div><img alt="Google"src="./../assets/google.png"><p>Hey guys, you ever get the feeling that Google is spying on us? Yeah? Well, They’re probably watching me like, ‘This dude spent 45 minutes Googling if you can reheat fries without them getting soggy. Then he searched ‘how to be productive’ and immediately watched cat videos for two hours. And don’t even get me started on those creepy ads. I just think about buying new shoes, and suddenly every website is like, ‘Hey buddy, you want some sneakers?’ Like, calm down, Google, I wasn’t even sure yet! At this point, I don’t even need friends to check on me—Google’s already like, ‘Hey, it’s been three days since you drank water. You good?<br>"للاسف مش هقدر اكذب عليك و اقولك انهم مش بيراقبونا دي فعلا الحقيقة"</p></div><div><img alt="Facebook"src="./../assets/facebook.svg"><p>You guys ever notice how Facebook knows everything about you? It’s like that one nosy aunt at family gatherings. You post a picture, and suddenly it’s like, ‘Hey, remember this from 10 years ago?’ No, Facebook, I was ugly back then—let’s leave the past in the past! And the friend suggestions? Facebook is like, ‘You might know John.’ Who is John?! We have one mutual friend from a party in 2014—I don’t even remember being at that party! Facebook out here trying to reunite me with people I actively chose to forget. And the worst part? You say one thing out loud, and BOOM—your entire feed is ads for it. I mentioned yoga once, and now Facebook thinks I’m on a spiritual journey. Chill, Facebook, I just wanted stretchy pants<br>"فيسبوك مش بس بيراقبونا هما واكلين معانا عيش و ملح "</p></div><div><img alt="Shimaaaaaaaaaaaaa"src="./../assets/shimaa.jpg"><p>this is shimaaaaaaaaa , my little duck<br>"بطتشيييييي"</p></div><div><img alt="lololololololololo"src="./../assets/za3'roota.webp"><p>this is called in Egypt "زغروطة" , bete3raf teza3'rat ? , Egyption Womens have master degree in Za3'rataaa 😂😂</p></div><div><img alt="BasBosa"src="./../assets/Basbosa.jpg"><p>this is my cat , Please say " ما شاء الله تبارك الله"</p></div></div></body></html>
