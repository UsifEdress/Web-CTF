بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم❤️

Hello Everyone,

My name is Youssef Edress.

I have created this beginner-friendly Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge for our Winter Workshop students as part of their learning experience.

Through this CTF, we aimed to illustrate the process of enumeration and highlight various vulnerabilities such as Server-Side Request Forgery
(SSRF), SQL Injection, Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR), File Upload Exploits, Business Logic Attacks (BLV), and Brocken Access Control (BAC).

**Note:**
You are welcome to clone this repository for any educational or collaborative purposes. I am open to any suggestions or opportunities to
contribute to the cybersecurity community❤️ and help improve our collective knowledge❤️.

This is my first attempt at creating a CTF, so please excuse any challenges you may encounter. I understand that it might not be as refined as
some of the more advanced CTFs we see today.

For those interested in exploring the solutions, here’s the link to the shared folder:

Thank you for your understanding and support.


سبحانك اللهم و بحمدك أشهد ان لا اله الا انت استغفرك و اتوب اليك ❤️
